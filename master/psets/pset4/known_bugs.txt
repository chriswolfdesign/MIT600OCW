find_best_shifts()
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Uses global variables instead of returning as specified by assignment.

- All words must have new encryption up until the final shift
	(May be intended by specification)

- Cannot use words that repeat a letter immediately
	ex. 'Assignment" has two 's' in a row and therefore does not work
